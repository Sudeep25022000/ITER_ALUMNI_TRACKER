# Alumni Tracking System (Hackerwar2020)-
  A complete info based on the graduates of "Institute of Technical Education and Research".

The web based application will have the following features â€“

Allow alumini members to register themselves.
Allow colleges to verify & authenticate their registered alumini.
Provision for alumini members to update their details
Allow colleges to search details based on criteria such as year, subject, etc
Send messages and emails to alumini members
Group chats, create events, publish notices on the portal
Security features with login for every user.
Technologies to be used : HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL

The project is to be developed by pseudeo Devops a team for Hackerwar 2.0
